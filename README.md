# libGDX-Hex-Tile-Testing

Personal testing of libGDX's hexagonal tile functionality.

Initial starting point is the [Hexagonal Tiled Map Test](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/HexagonalTiledMapTest.java) and my own [Orthographic Camera Controller starter](https://gist.github.com/JamesSkemp/fa2a9bd79a1d6336b247).
